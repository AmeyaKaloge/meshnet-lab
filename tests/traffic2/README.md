# Traffic Test 2

The mesh routing program batman-adv is tested on lattice structures of different sizes.
Test platfom is a i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz (2 cores) with 8 GB RAM.
Every test was performed 10 times to calculate the standard deviation (error bars).

## Result

## Creation

`sudo ./run.sh` runs the test (will take about a day).
`./plot.sh` will create graphs using gnuplot.
