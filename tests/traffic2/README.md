The mesh routing program batman-adv is tested on lattice structures of different sizes.
Every test was performed 10 times to calculate the standard deviation (error bars).

## Run

* remove remaining `*.csv` files in this directory
* execute `sudo ./run.sh` to run the test (will take a long time).
* `./plot.sh` will create graphs using gnuplot
