# Convergence Test 1

Test the convergence of different routing protocols on three topologies (line, lattice and a random tree) of 100 nodes each.

## Run

* remove remaining `*.csv` files in this directory
* execute `sudo ./run.sh` to run the test (will take a long time).
* `./plot.sh` will create graphs using gnuplot
