# Traffic Test 1

Test the about of traffic caused by different routing protocols on different topologies:

- different sizes of line, lattice and random tree topologies
- different Freifunk network topologies

`sudo ./run.sh` runs the test (will take a long time).
`./plot.sh` will create graphs using gnuplot.
